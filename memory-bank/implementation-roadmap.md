## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Weather API rate limits or outages | Medium | High | Implement aggressive caching, fallback providers, graceful degradation |
| Map rendering performance issues on mobile | Medium | Medium | Use appropriate tile sizes, limit concurrent markers, implement clustering |
| Browser compatibility issues | Low | Medium | Establish browser support matrix, implement feature detection, provide fallbacks |
| Local storage limitations | Low | Medium | Monitor storage usage, implement cleanup strategies, prioritize critical data |

### Project Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Maintain clear requirements documentation, implement feature flagging, prioritize MoSCoW categories |
| Performance degradation with feature addition | Medium | Medium | Regular performance testing, establish performance budgets, optimize continuously |
| Usability challenges with complex features | Medium | Medium | Conduct user testing, implement progressive disclosure, provide clear documentation |
| API provider changes or deprecations | Low | High | Abstract third-party dependencies, monitor provider announcements, maintain contingency plans |
